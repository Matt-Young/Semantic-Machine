A collection of files that work with sqlite3, mainly to implement a 
nested store or serialize format for storing BSON data.  The point is to use Bson streams as bots for
the purpose of remote query, machine to machine query and query processing, ontology navigation, and dynamic distribution of data.

All data is assumed to be Bson format, except fo the Json console.  All data is assumed capable of bot travel by key work navigation.
